O USAGE

    open FsExecute
    
    (ExecAsync "ls -alh")
    <|> (Failure, fun result -> eprintfn $"{result.StandardError}")
    <|> (Success, fun result -> printfn $"{result.StandardOutput}")

O API

    module FsExecute

    type ExitStatus =
        | Success
        | Failure

    type CommandResult =
        { ExitCode: int
          StandardOutput: string
          StandardError: string }


    val Exec: string -> Async<CommandResult>
    val ExecAsync: string -> CommandResult

    val Bind: CommandResult -> (ExitStatus * (CommandResult -> unit)) -> CommandResult
    val (<|>): (CommandResult -> (ExitStatus * (CommandResult -> unit)) -> CommandResult)
